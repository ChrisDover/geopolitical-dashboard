    "summary": "Markets systematically misprice geopolitical tail risk due to recency bias and institutional risk aversion. We exploit market inefficiencies by taking long positions in underpriced conflict scenarios and short positions in overpriced fear trades.",
    "coreBeliefs": [
      "Prediction markets underestimate Middle East escalation risk (Iran-Israel, Saudi-Iran)",
      "Markets overestimate direct China-Taiwan invasion probability (institutions anchored to Ukraine analogy)",
      "South China Sea confrontation risk is significantly mispriced given naval buildups",
      "North Korea crisis probability is elevated due to Kim's health uncertainties",
      "Market participants anchor to recent headlines rather than fundamental probability drivers"
